<h2>6) What is the importance of having an emulator within the Android environment?</h2>

The emulator lets developers “play” around an interface that acts as if it were an actual mobile device. They can write and test codes, and even debug. Emulators are a safe place for testing codes especially if it is in the early design phase.

<h2>7) What is a Context?</h2>
